# Cancer-Diagnosis-Classifier

+++Dataset

 The dataset Cancer_Data.csv is used in this project

+++Features

 The project involves the following key features:

-> Data preprocessing and splitting into training and testing sets.

-> Implementation of PCA and LDA for dimensionality reduction.

-> Implementation of Logistic Regression and KNN classifiers.

-> Genetic Algorithm for feature selection.

+++Models and Techniques

-> Logistic Regression:

  A linear model used for binary classification tasks.
  Applied on raw data, PCA-transformed data, and LDA-transformed data.
  
-> K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):

  A non-parametric method used for classification.
  Applied on raw data, PCA-transformed data, and LDA-transformed data.
  
-> Principal Component Analysis (PCA):

  A technique used for dimensionality reduction by projecting data onto a lower-dimensional space.
  
-> Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA):

  A technique used for dimensionality reduction that focuses on maximizing the separability between classes.
  
-> Genetic Algorithm for Feature Selection:

  An optimization technique used to select the best subset of features for model training.
